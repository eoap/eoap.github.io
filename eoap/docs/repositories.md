## Open and reproducible EO Application Package

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![stability-wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-wip-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/software-guides/blob/master/STABILITY-BADGES.md#work-in-progress)

Many cloud-based solutions for workflows in EO are available to users today, but only few support reproducibility or comply with FAIR data principles. 

This short tutorial demonstrates how EO Application Packages meet these requirements.
