# Resources and Guides for Earth Observation Application Packages

This project includes several repositories designed to provide guidance and training material for developing and executing Earth Observation (EO) Application Packages in compliance with OGC standards. The repositories aims to:

* help developers create EO applications using the Common Workflow Language (CWL)
* provide an overview of the CWL, its key concepts
* how to build a CWL-based EO application using practical examples in field guides. 

The repositories are listed below, and described in detailed in the [Repositories](repositories.md) section:

* "Application Package and CWL as a solution for EO portability"
* "Understanding STAC for input/output data modelling in EO Applications"
* "Quickwin - A simple Application Package for getting started"
* "Mastering EO Application Packaging with CWL"
* "Quickwin - An Application Package with inline Python code"
* "Open and reproducible EO Application Package"
* "Inference with the EO Application Package"
