# Resources and Guides for Earth Observation Application Packages

This project includes several repositories designed to provide guidance and training material for developing and executing Earth Observation (EO) Application Packages in compliance with the OGC Best Practice for Earth Observation Application Package. 

The repositories aim to:

* Help developers create portable and deployable EO applications using the Common Workflow Language (CWL)
* provide an overview of the CWL, its key concepts 
* Show how to build a CWL-based EO application using a practical examples then used in several execution scenarios. 

The repositories are listed below, and described in detailed in the [Repositories](repositories.md) section:

**Application Package and CWL as a solution for EO portability**

This module provides an light introduction to CWL as a solution for the portability of EO applications.

**Understanding STAC for input/output data modelling in EO Applications**

This module includes documentation and notebooks for understanding:

* The role of STAC as input/output data manifests in EO applications and a hands-on with real-life scenarios.
* How platforms manage the stage-in and stage-out operations 

**Quickwin - A simple Application Package for getting started**

This module is designed for developers, scientists, and EO enthusiasts who want to get started with the EO Application Package.

**Mastering EO Application Packaging with CWL**

This module is designed for developers, scientists, and EO enthusiasts who want to enhance their skills in creating and sharing EO Application Packages.

**Quickwin - An Application Package with inline Python code**

This tutorial is designed for developers, scientists, and Earth observation enthusiasts who want to get quickly started with the EO Application Package.

**OGC API Processes with ZOO Project**

This module is designed for developers, scientists, and Earth observation enthusiasts who want to:

* Get acquainted with the OGC API Processes standard and its ZOO-Project implementation
* Deploy and run Application Packages as web services

**Open and reproducible EO Application Package**

Many cloud-based solutions for workflows in EO are available to users today, but only few support reproducibility or comply with FAIR data principles. 

This short module demonstrates how EO Application Packages meet these requirements.

**Inference with the EO Application Package**

This tutorial addresses the packaging of the an EO application that does the inference using an ONNX model.
